ArrayList:

* It is a class which implemented by list interface.
* Heterogeneous data's are allowed.
* Insertion order is preserved.
* Duplicate elements are allowed.
* It allows random access because the array list work on the index basis.
* Multiple null values are allowed.


LinkedList:

* It is a class which implemented by list and queue interface.
* Heterogeneous data's are allowed.
* Insertion order is preserved.
* Duplicate elements are allowed.
* Insertion/deletion (manipulation) is fast because no shifting needs to occur.
* Multiple null values are allowed.


Difference: 

ArrayList

Underlying Array data structure
Insertion/Deletion operations slower than LinkedList - O(N)
Random access is faster than LinkedList
Memory efficient - it only stores the objects in the list
Memory Allocation - Contiguous memory is allocated


LinkedList

Underlying Doubly linked list data structure
Insertion/Deletion operations faster than ArrayList - O(1)
Random access is slower than ArrayList
Memory inefficient - it only stores the object and pointers in the next and previous nodes.
Memory Allocation - Contiguous memory is not allocated
