HashSet:

* It is a class which implemented by set interface.
* Heterogeneous data's are allowed.
* Insertion order is not preserved.
* Duplicate elements are not allowed.
* Multiple null values are not allowed, only single null is allowed.
* HashSet stores the element using hashing mechanism.
* HashSet is the best approach for search operations.



Linked HashSet:

* It is a class which implemented by set interface.
* Heterogeneous data's are allowed.
* Insertion order is preserved (by index).
* Duplicate elements are not allowed.
* Multiple null values are not allowed, only single null is allowed.
* LinkedHashSet has a hashtable + linkedlist datastructure.


Difference:

HashSet:

* It uses hashtable to store the elements.
* Insertion order is not preserved.
* It allows only one null value.
* Less memory usage
* Performance faster than linked hashset.
* Extends Abstract class

Linked HashSet:

* It uses hashtable + doubly linkedlist to store the elements and maintain the insertion order of the elements.
* Insertion order is preserved.
* It allows only one null value.
* requires more memory usage
* Performance lower than HashSet
* Extends HashSet class
